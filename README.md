# qmlAlembic - Alembic QML plugin for Qt3D

qmlAlembic is a C++ QML plugin providing classes to load and visualize Alembic point cloud files in Qt3D.
It has been developed to load [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) sparse reconstruction results inside [Meshroom](https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom).
